# Spinning Shapes
## Description
A simple C++ program that animates spinning shapes (e.g. a donut and a cube). It involves practice in the mathematical representation of 3D objects and ray casting in computer graphics.
The rotation matrices and normal vectors are used to implement the light effect and the revolution of shapes.
